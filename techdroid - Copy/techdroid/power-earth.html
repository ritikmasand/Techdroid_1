    <p>In the simplest terms, it can be defined as the collection, transportation, and disposal of garbage, sewage, and other waste products.The process of waste management involves treating solid and liquid waste. During the treatment, it also offers a variety of solutions for recycling items that aren’t categorized as trash.

      The entire idea thus boils down to re-using garbage as a valuable resource and given our current environmental climate, this process is extremely vital for all households and businesses.<br>
      
      According to Wikipedia,
      
      “Waste management or Waste disposal is all the activities and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal. This includes amongst other things, collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste together with monitoring and regulation. It also encompasses the legal and regulatory framework that relates to waste management encompassing guidance on recycling etc.”
      
      You will find there are eight major groups of waste management methods, each of them divided into numerous categories. Those groups include source reduction and reuse, animal feeding, recycling, composting, fermentation, landfills, incineration, and land application.

    <p><b>Benefits of Waste Management</b><br>
      <b>1)Better Environment:</b>

      Probably the biggest advantage of managing waste is that it eventually leads to a better and fresher environment.
      
      Waste disposal units also contribute to the well-being of people by helping them become disease-free. The best part: all of this happens while the unnecessary is duly disposed of in a proper and sanitary manner.
      
      Multiple waste disposal units should be placed in tier-1 and tier-2 cities in a bid to prep up the process of waste disposal. This will also help implement remarkable safety measures in the long run.<br>
      
    <b>2)Reduces Pollution:</b>
      When waste is managed the right way, it doesn’t merely eliminate the subsequent waste but also reduces the impact and the intensity of harmful greenhouse gases like carbon-di-oxide, carbon mono-oxide, and methane that are often exuded from accumulated wastes in landfills.
      Managing waste reduces our reliance on landfills while also significantly cutting down the many factors that adversely impact our environment.<br>


      <b>3)Conserves Energy:</b>
      Recycling is one of the biggest aspects of waste management, and over time, it helps conserve energy. One of the biggest instances of this advantage can be traced to the practice of recycling paper.
      
      All of us are probably aware that thousands of trees are cut to produce paper. When a used paper is recycled to create new paper, the need of cutting trees is significantly minimized. This helps conserve energy while also reducing your carbon footprints.<br>
      
      <b>4)Creates Employment:</b>
      The recycling industry alone creates hundreds of jobs. As more people adopt this eco-friendly practice, organizations creating and selling recycled products come to the forefront. This helps boost their business while also creating hundreds of jobs.<br>
      
      <b>5)Helps Make a Difference:</b>
      By managing waste, you are also making a difference to the society and the world in general. While none of us can completely get rid of garbage, we can always adopt eco-friendly practices of reducing and reusing waste. This way, you create an example for the people around you, who in turn are now motivated to embrace a sustainable approach.
