    <p><b>Why is plastic waste management important?</b><br>Plastic is one of the most popular materials used all around the world. You name a thing and it’s made up of plastic! From shampoo bottles and carry bags to computers and batteries, all have some element of plastic present in them. Being used so commonly all over the world, the waste generated from the use of the element is enormous. This waste, if not managed properly, has numerous ill-effects on the environment and living beings. Hence, plastic waste management is very important.<br><b>Plastic:A Threat</b><br>Despite having a lot of advantageous properties, the ways plastic impacts the environment can’t be neglected. Plastic confers countless ill-effects, which are as follows:-<ul><li><strong>Non-Biodegradable:&nbsp;</strong>Plastic stays in the environment forever. Plastic can’t be decomposed. Recycling plastic is the only way to stop plastic waste that degrades the environment.</li><li><strong>Health ailments:&nbsp;</strong>Burning plastic leads to the emission of numerous harmful gases and toxic chemicals which leads to respiratory problems, cancer, birth defects, and many other health problems.</li><li><strong>Water contamination and accumulation:&nbsp;</strong>Plastic, on entering water sources, contaminates the source, making it unfit for drinking. Also plastic leads to the accumulation of rainwater as it hinders seepage of water and hence, the place becomes a breeding place for mosquitoes and other insects.</li><li><strong>Threats to wildlife:</strong>&nbsp;Plastic affects wildlife drastically. Animals and birds swallow plastic which chokes their wind and food pipes leading to their death. Hence, plastic destroys food chains.</li></ul>

    <p><b>Plastic Waste Management: A Solution</b><br>Plastic waste management refers to managing the plastic waste generated and processing it to make it reusable. Millions of tons of plastic waste generated every year because of plastic bottles, polythene bags, and other plastic items. Since, plastic non-biodegradable, reusing it again is the only alternative. In the case of thermoplastics, the product can be reshaped into desirable products, but thermosetting plastics pose a challenge. Most of the plastic waste generated is made up of thermosetting plastic. These plastics can’t be reshaped. Managing plastic waste is a challenging task. It involves the conversion of thermoplastics into desired products and recycling or reusing the thermosetting plastic.<br>
    <b>The 3R's of Plastic Waste Management</b><br>The plastic waste generated can be managed using 3 R’s of plastic waste management – Reduce, Reuse and Recycle. Since plastic can’t be destroyed, the R’s of waste management is the best alternative.<ul><li><strong>Reduce:&nbsp;</strong>The first ‘R’ of plastic waste management is ‘Reduce’ i.e reducing the use of plastic as much as possible. Less we will use the plastic, the less will be the waste generated. Using alternatives for plastic can solve this problem to a large extent. For example, using paper bags instead of polythene bags helps in reducing the use of plastic. Many big companies and organizations have already stopped the use of plastic and resorted to their alternatives.</li><li><strong>Reuse:</strong>&nbsp;The second ‘R’of plastic waste management is ‘Reuse’ i.e reusing the plastic-made products. Reusing plastic will promote the lesser production of plastic. For example, a plastic bottle can be used several times. Similarly, instead of throwing a polythene bag, reusing it can help in plastic waste management.</li><li><strong>Recycling:</strong>&nbsp;The third ‘R’ of plastic waste management id ‘Recycling’ i.e converting used plastic products into raw plastic and further converting it into another product to reuse it again. This will promote lesser production of plastic and hence, will reduce the amount of waste generated.</li></ul><b>Other ways of reducung Plastic waste:</b><ul><li><strong>Incinerators:&nbsp;</strong>incinerators are used to burn plastic. These are generally located outside the cities. The technique of incinerators helps in eliminating a large volume of plastic. Though these incinerators have a drawback that they cause air pollution, with the improvement in technology, this drawback will be eliminated shortly.</li><li><strong>Using segregated dustbins:&nbsp;</strong>using segregated dustbins for plastic makes it easy to identify the plastic products, making it convenient for the recycling industries to treat plastic waste. Otherwise, segregating plastic waste and other waste requires a lot of time and effort.</li><li><strong>Government licensing and Pollution Rights:&nbsp;</strong>The government can issue licenses and pollution rights for the plastic industries.&nbsp; Pollution rights specify the maxing amount of waste a factory can generate.</li><li><strong>Creating awareness:</strong>&nbsp;Educating people about the harmful effects of using plastic can help in reducing plastic waste to a large extent.</li></ul></p>
