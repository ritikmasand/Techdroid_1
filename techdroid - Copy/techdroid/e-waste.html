    <p><b>What is E-waste?</b><br>
      E-waste is any electrical or electronic equipment that’s been discarded. This includes working and broken items that are thrown in the garbage or donated to a charity reseller like Goodwill. Often, if the item goes unsold in the store, it will be thrown away. E-waste is particularly dangerous due to toxic chemicals that naturally leach from the metals inside when buried.<br><b>Dangers of E-waste:</b><br>According to the World Health Organization (WHO), health risks may result from direct contact with toxic materials that leach from e-waste. These include minerals such as lead, cadmium, chromium, brominated flame retardants, or polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Danger can come from inhalation of the toxic fumes, as well as from the accumulation of chemicals in soil, water, and food.

      This puts not just people in danger but land and sea animals as well. In developing countries, the risks are exceptionally high because some developed countries send their e-waste there. Studies have shown this global e-waste has detrimental effects on the people that work with the e-waste but also the people that live around it.
      
      Because of this, a proper recycling process needs to be put in place to protect us and future generations.<br>
      <b>E-waste Disposal:</b><br>Since we know consumers will keep buying new devices, it’s important to keep reinforcing that message that we need to recycle the older models, not throw them out.

      There are serious environmental risks if we send our electronics to a landfill. In contrast, recycling provides considerable benefits to our environment.
      
      The solution is to turn those devices over to an experienced firm like TechDroid which will perform environmentally friendly recycling of electronic products.
      
      The process is simple: gather your old and unused electronics like you would your garbage. A trash can or bin is perfect for this. For larger appliances, you usually want to gather them along with your smaller electronics in a garage. Then, sell us the e-waste. SIMPLE!.

    <p><b>What is the Solution?</b>
      <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Re-evaluate.</strong> Do you really need that extra gadget? Try finding one device with multiple functions.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Extend the life of your electronics.</strong>&nbsp;Buy a case, keep your device clean, and avoid overcharging the battery.&nbsp;</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Buy environmentally friendly electronics.</strong> Look for products labeled Energy Star or certified by the Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT).</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Donate used electronics to social programs</strong>—and help victims of domestic violence, children safety initiatives, environmental causes, and more. Ask your student REP for a postage paid mailer for your cell phone or ink cartridge. For each item received, the World Wildlife Fund will receive one dollar.</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reuse large electronics.</strong>&nbsp;Post to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/harvardgradmarket/" target="_blank">Harvard’s Reuse List</a></li>
      <li>
        <strong>Recycle electronics and batteries in e-waste recycling bins located around campus.</strong>&nbsp; Large electronics can go in the larger bins found in your building. &nbsp;</li>
    </ul></p>
